# EseOkonofuaDotCom2 
[My second personal website](http://eokonofua.com)
I've made. This was a good way to practice redux coding and also to flex the design portion of my brain. <br/>
The website was made to be very customizable allowing anyone to be able to spool up their own personal website in a similar style too. This customizability is achieved by using data fetched from the **website.json** file which can be freely altered.

## Technology stack
- Node.js for api and web server.
- Openweather API for weather stuff.
- React/Redux for unidirectional data management.
- *Redux thunk* for Asynchronous store management. 
- *React Router* For organization.
- SCSS for dynamic styling.

## Installation
```javascript
npm install
npm start
```
