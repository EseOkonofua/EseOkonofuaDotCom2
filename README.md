# EseOkonofuaDotCom2 
[The website](https://eokonofuadotcom2.herokuapp.com)
My second personal website I've made. This was a good way to practice redux coding and also to flex the design portion of my brain.
The website was made to be customizable using data fetched from the **website.json** file.

## Technology stack
- Node.js for api and web server.
- Openweather API for weather stuff.
- React/Redux for unidirectional data management.
- *Redux thunk* for Asynchronous store management. 
- *React Router* For organization.
- SCSS for dynamic styling.

## Installation
```javascript
npm install
npm start
```
